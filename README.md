# Penalized-Regression-Machine-Learning

## About the Dataset
- Purpose: The dataset is used to study penalized regression techniques in a supervised learning context.
- Nature: Includes features for regression modeling with potential multicollinearity, making it suitable for techniques like Ridge and Lasso regression.
- Focus: Identifies predictors with the most significant impact on a target variable while managing overfitting and improving model interpretability.

## What I Did in the Project
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the dataset was ready for modeling.
- Feature Selection: Evaluated and selected significant predictors to reduce noise and improve model performance.
- Penalized Regression Techniques: Implemented Ridge and Lasso regression to manage multicollinearity and optimize predictive power.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Used cross-validation to fine-tune regularization parameters for both Ridge and Lasso regression models.
- Model Evaluation: Compared model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to assess predictive accuracy.
- Interpretability: Visualized coefficient shrinkage and predictor importance to demonstrate the effects of regularization.
